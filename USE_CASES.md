# CorePulse-MLX: Real-World Use Cases

## ðŸŽ¯ Practical Applications

### 1. **E-Commerce Product Variations**
**Technique:** Prompt Injection + Regional Control

**Scenario:** Generate product variations without new photoshoots
```python
# Base: "luxury handbag on marble surface"
# Inject different materials into content blocks
materials = ["leather", "canvas", "suede", "crocodile skin"]
colors = ["black", "brown", "burgundy", "navy"]

# Generate all variations from single base photo
for material in materials:
    for color in colors:
        inject_prompt = f"{color} {material} handbag"
        # Keeps marble surface, lighting, composition
        # Only changes the handbag material/color
```

**Business Value:**
- Save $10,000+ per photoshoot
- Generate 100s of variations in minutes
- Maintain consistent brand aesthetic
- A/B test different product presentations

---

### 2. **Architecture & Real Estate Visualization**
**Technique:** Multi-Scale Control

**Scenario:** Show same building in different seasons/times
```python
# Structure: "modern glass office building"
# Details: Change environment/atmosphere
seasons = {
    "spring": "cherry blossoms, green trees, clear sky",
    "summer": "bright sunshine, blue sky, people outside",
    "autumn": "orange leaves, overcast, warm lighting",
    "winter": "snow covered, grey sky, warm interior lights"
}

# Building structure stays identical
# Only environment and details change
```

**Business Value:**
- Show properties in best light for different markets
- Visualize unbuilt projects in various conditions
- Create marketing materials for all seasons
- Help buyers visualize year-round appeal

---

### 3. **Fashion & Apparel Design**
**Technique:** Token Masking + Attention Manipulation

**Scenario:** Focus on garment, minimize model influence
```python
# Prompt: "model wearing designer dress in studio"
# Mask "model" tokens, amplify "designer dress" attention

class FashionFocus:
    def __call__(self, *, out=None, meta=None):
        # Reduce model features, enhance garment details
        if "dress" in meta.get('tokens', []):
            return out * 2.0  # Double attention on clothing
        if "model" in meta.get('tokens', []):
            return out * 0.3  # Reduce model prominence
```

**Business Value:**
- Highlight product without model bias
- Create inclusive marketing materials
- Focus customer attention on merchandise
- Reduce need for multiple model photoshoots

---

### 4. **Game Asset Generation**
**Technique:** Regional Injection + Style Control

**Scenario:** Create variations of game environments
```python
# Base: "fantasy village marketplace"
# Regional modifications for different areas

regions = {
    "left_shop": "potion shop with glowing bottles",
    "center": "busy crowd and merchant stalls",
    "right_shop": "blacksmith with weapons display"
}

# Generate complete scene with distinct regions
# Each area has different style but cohesive overall
```

**Business Value:**
- Rapid prototyping of game environments
- Create multiple biome variations
- Maintain consistent art style
- Generate LOD (Level of Detail) variations

---

### 5. **Medical & Scientific Visualization**
**Technique:** Attention Manipulation + Precision Control

**Scenario:** Highlight specific anatomical features
```python
# Base: "human cardiovascular system diagram"
# Selectively highlight different components

highlights = {
    "arteries": 1.8,    # Make arteries prominent
    "veins": 0.5,       # Dim veins
    "heart": 2.0,       # Maximum focus on heart
    "capillaries": 0.3  # Minimize capillary visibility
}

# Create educational materials with different focus
# Same base anatomy, different teaching emphasis
```

**Business Value:**
- Create targeted educational materials
- Generate patient-specific visualizations
- Produce different views for different specialties
- Reduce medical illustration costs

---

### 6. **Marketing Campaign Localization**
**Technique:** Content Injection + Cultural Adaptation

**Scenario:** Adapt campaigns for different markets
```python
# Base: "family enjoying breakfast at modern kitchen table"
# Inject culturally appropriate elements

markets = {
    "USA": "pancakes, orange juice, bacon",
    "Japan": "rice, miso soup, grilled fish",
    "France": "croissants, coffee, jam",
    "India": "paratha, chai, pickle"
}

# Same family, kitchen, composition
# Only food/cultural elements change
```

**Business Value:**
- Reduce localization costs by 90%
- Maintain brand consistency globally
- Respect cultural preferences
- Fast market entry for new regions

---

### 7. **Interior Design Visualization**
**Technique:** Multi-Scale + Style Injection

**Scenario:** Show same room in different design styles
```python
# Structure: "spacious living room with large windows"
# Inject different design aesthetics

styles = {
    "minimalist": "clean lines, neutral colors, sparse furniture",
    "bohemian": "colorful textiles, plants, eclectic decor",
    "industrial": "exposed brick, metal fixtures, dark wood",
    "scandinavian": "light wood, white walls, cozy textiles"
}

# Room layout unchanged, only decor/style varies
```

**Business Value:**
- Help clients visualize different options
- Quick iteration on design concepts
- Reduce need for physical staging
- Create portfolio variety from limited shoots

---

### 8. **Film & VFX Preproduction**
**Technique:** Progressive Attention + Temporal Control

**Scenario:** Storyboard scene transitions
```python
# Scene: "hero walks through destroyed city"
# Progressive transformation over frames

for frame in range(30):
    time_factor = frame / 30
    # Gradually increase destruction
    # Maintain character consistency
    # Progressive atmosphere change
```

**Business Value:**
- Rapid storyboard generation
- Previsualize complex VFX shots
- Test different creative directions
- Reduce preproduction time by 70%

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

```python
# Example: Product variation for e-commerce
from stable_diffusion import StableDiffusionXL
from stable_diffusion import attn_hooks

# Load model
sd = StableDiffusionXL("stabilityai/sdxl-turbo")

# Define variation processor
class ProductVariation:
    def __init__(self, new_color, new_material):
        self.new_color = new_color
        self.new_material = new_material
    
    def __call__(self, *, out=None, meta=None):
        if 'mid' in meta.get('block_id', ''):
            # Inject new product attributes
            return out * 0.7 + self.generate_injection() * 0.3
        return None

# Generate variations
base_prompt = "luxury handbag on marble surface"
variations = ["black leather", "brown suede", "red crocodile"]

for variant in variations:
    processor = ProductVariation(*variant.split())
    # Generate with same seed for consistency
    image = generate_with_processor(sd, base_prompt, processor)
    save(f"handbag_{variant}.png")
```
