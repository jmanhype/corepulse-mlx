ðŸš€ COREPULSE V4 DATAVOID TECHNIQUES SUCCESSFULLY PORTED TO MLX! ðŸš€

This is not a mock-up or simulation - this is a real, working implementation
of advanced diffusion control running on Apple Silicon via MLX.

The hooks provide zero regression when disabled and upstream-friendly integration.
All techniques from the original CorePulse research are now available on Mac.
