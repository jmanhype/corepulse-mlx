# CorePulse MLX Implementation Status

## The Real CorePulse Approach

After examining the actual CorePulse repository, here's what they're REALLY doing:

### 1. UNet Patching Architecture
```python
# CorePulse patches the UNet's attention processors at runtime
with UNetPatcher(pipeline) as patcher:
    patcher.add_injection(
        block="middle:0",     # Target specific UNet blocks
        prompt="dragon",      # Inject this prompt
        weight=2.0,          # Injection strength
        sigma_start=15.0,    # When to start (noise level)
        sigma_end=0.0        # When to stop
    )
    result = pipeline("a cat", num_inference_steps=30)
    # Result: Dragon appears instead of cat
```

### 2. How It Actually Works

1. **Block-Level Targeting**: 
   - `input` blocks (down_blocks) → Overall composition
   - `middle` blocks (mid_block) → Core content
   - `output` blocks (up_blocks) → Fine details

2. **Sigma-Based Timing**:
   - High sigma (15-3): Structure formation
   - Medium sigma (3-0.5): Feature development  
   - Low sigma (0.5-0): Detail refinement

3. **Attention Processor Replacement**:
   ```python
   # They replace the default attention with custom processors
   module.processor = CustomAttentionProcessor(
       original_processor,
       injection_configs
   )
   ```

4. **Runtime Modification**:
   - Modifies cross-attention during forward pass
   - Injects different prompts into different blocks
   - Controls when injections apply via sigma values

## What We Tried

### Attempt 1: Simple Prompt Manipulation ❌
- Just changed prompts externally
- No actual model modification
- Result: Limited effect

### Attempt 2: Attention Weight Setting ❌
- Set weights but couldn't apply them
- MLX SD doesn't expose attention internals
- Result: No visible difference

### Attempt 3: Hooking Attention Layers ❌
- Tried to hook MLX attention modules
- MLX doesn't use the same processor architecture
- Result: Hooks don't work

## The Core Problem

**MLX Stable Diffusion vs HuggingFace Diffusers:**

| Feature | HuggingFace Diffusers | MLX Stable Diffusion |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Attention Processors | ✅ Exposed & Replaceable | ❌ Internal Only |
| UNet Block Access | ✅ Full Access | ⚠️ Limited Access |
| Forward Hooks | ✅ Supported | ❌ Not Exposed |
| Runtime Patching | ✅ Designed For It | ❌ Not Designed For It |

## What Actually Works with MLX

### 1. Prompt Engineering (Limited) ✅
```python
# Simulate attention boost through repetition
prompt = "ultra photorealistic, extremely photorealistic, highly detailed"
```

### 2. Multiple Generations ✅
```python
# Generate structure, then details
structure = sd.generate("cathedral silhouette")
details = sd.generate("intricate stone carvings")
```

### 3. Seed Control ✅
```python
# Same seed preserves composition
cat = sd.generate("cat in park", seed=42)
dog = sd.generate("dog in park", seed=42)  # Same scene, different subject
```

## To Get Real CorePulse on MLX

We would need to:

### Option 1: Modify MLX Stable Diffusion Core
1. Fork `mlx-examples/stable_diffusion`
2. Add attention processor architecture
3. Expose UNet block access
4. Implement sigma-based injection system

### Option 2: Create MLX-Native Implementation
1. Build custom UNet with exposed attention
2. Implement proper block-level control
3. Add sigma-based timing system
4. Create MLX-optimized attention processors

### Option 3: Bridge to HuggingFace
1. Use HuggingFace models with CorePulse
2. Convert results to MLX tensors
3. Lose MLX performance benefits

## Current Status

### What We Have ✅
- Basic prompt manipulation demos
- Visual comparisons showing techniques
- Understanding of CorePulse architecture
- Multiple generation approaches

### What We Don't Have ❌
- True UNet patching in MLX
- Block-level prompt injection
- Sigma-based timing control
- Runtime attention modification
- Token-level masking that preserves context
- Regional control with spatial precision

## The Verdict

**CorePulse's techniques require low-level model access that MLX Stable Diffusion doesn't provide.**

To get 100% working CorePulse on Apple Silicon, we need to either:
1. Modify MLX SD core implementation
2. Port CorePulse to use Metal Performance Shaders directly
3. Use HuggingFace Diffusers (losing MLX optimization)

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Use:
- Use prompt engineering workarounds
- Combine multiple generations
- Control via seeds and careful prompting

### For Full Implementation:
- Fork and modify mlx-examples/stable_diffusion
- Add proper attention processor architecture
- Implement UNet patching system
- Create MLX-optimized version of CorePulse

### Key Insight:
CorePulse isn't just about prompts - it's about **surgically modifying how the model processes information at specific layers and times**. Without that low-level access, we can only approximate the effects.
